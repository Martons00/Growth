Life is about creating yourself.' \n\nThis story is about growing up as a person with the hope that it will inspire someone else. \nIt is told through the use of animated paintings and a description that accompanies the reader to interpret them and identify with them by translating them into his growth path. \n\nEvery negative thing leaves us scars but also something to teach us."

                  "Anxieties and frustrations then transform. \nThey turn into anger. \nA rage that can hurt everything around it.",
                  "All this suffering can be a prison. \nFour walls from which it is difficult to get out. \nYou can keep bumping into the walls but you won't knock them down.",
                  "Asking for help is never wrong. \nTo get out of your prison. \nA good help can rekindle a new light that starts from within. \nIt is never a shame to acknowledge that you are not perfect and to ask for help.",
                  "Help is part of the change. \nBut real change can't start from anyone else but yourself. \nReal change can be triggered by challenges that may once have seemed impossible to you.",
                  "Growth is not a path that has an end but it is a continuous putting yourself on the line. \nThe same things that once made you sick can be put in your way. \nBut you will be different and you will have the possibility to face them differently. \n\nIn a new form and new light."]
